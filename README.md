# Portfolio - Made with React
Professional portfolio of computing skills and experience for **Dallin Wright**.  

Made using React through the Vite build tool with TypeScript and manual CSS. *Initially created Summer 2025*

## Why I made this from scratch
While I could have more easily used an existing template to quickly assemble a porfolio, I decided this was a great opportunity to self-teach. Building something from scratch--with as few external libraries as possible--as I did here is rarely the best option, but it served as an enjoyable learning experience.

## Status
This portfolio is still a work-in-progress! I'm still adding information about me and projects I'm passionate about.
